### Design tokens are the atoms of the system as [Salesforce](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/) describes them. In the LUX Design System they are used instead of hard coded values to ensure a better consistency across any platform.

The documentation you see below is auto generated by LUX. To see how it’s formatted, see [/docs/components/tokens/](https://github.com/pulibrary/lux/tree/master/docs/components/tokens).

Please note: You can use LUX tokens and styles in your local, custom (aka, non-LUX) Vue components. By importing them separately you will have access to all the Sass variables. Please see [the install instructions](https://github.com/pulibrary/lux/wiki/How-to-install-LUX#step-8) for details.
